Hi, I am Jiang Xu. I am a biomedical researcher. I used to be a medical student and I have a medical degree and majored in Neurology for my Ph.D. I also did a lot of recombinant protein structure work using x-ray diffraction and genome structure working using NGS method(such as Hi-C). My research projects forced me to start over to learn Python and some R, and I was shocked by the power of computer in recent years as my learning progressed. 
I am also a self-taught engineer. I used to use Autodesk AutoCAD and Inventor but switched to Fusion 360 since 2016. I also know a bit of arduino(probably in C++ or C, I  really can't tell the difference) and 3D printing. Taken together, these knowledge enable me to design and build interesting tools and gadgets. The codes and designs I posted here are partly for my hobby and partly for my work, and I am glad if you could find any of them useful in your projects. You can remodel and do whatever you want with these designs, and all I need is acknowlege my original design. Thanks!

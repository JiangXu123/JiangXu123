Hi, I am Jiang Xu. I am a biomedical researcher. I just got shocked by the power of computer in recent years as I learned Python and R, even though I learned a little bit of C when I was in college and BASIC when I was in middle school, which I mostly forgot. The code and design I posted here are partly for my hobby and partly for my work, and I am glad if you find any of them useful in your project. You can remodel and do whatever you want with these designs, and all I need is acknowlege my original design.Thanks.

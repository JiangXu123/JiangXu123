Hi, I am JiangXu123, I am a biomedical researche with medical background. I just got shocked by the power of computer as I learned Python, which I actually found very useful, even though
I learned C when I was in college and BASIC when I was in middle school, which I mostly forgot. The code and design I posted here is partly my hobby and partly my work, and I am glad if you 
find the stuff I posted here useful in your project.
